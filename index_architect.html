								From 2014 to 2017, I was employed as an Architect in Beijing Institute of Architectural Design, mainly responsible for doing Parametric Design and Computing Design by using the Grasshopper 3D which is a plug-in for Rhinoceros 3D that presents the users with a visual programming language interface to create and edit geometry. I found that I have a strong interest in the computer language and algorithm. They can easily simplify the complicated problems and improve the efficiency

											Making a abstraction of forest. The idea is made from Hiking. When people
											are hiking in forest, they are finding their specific position in a random tree
											layout according their own needs. Some people are finding places to read. Some people
											are finding places to have a lunch. Some people are finding places to have a rest as well.
											All seems to be random, but there must be one centain connecting between find a place and forest.

											The slum is a paradoxical phenomenon in India. On the one hand, it is regarded as the synonym of the worst, most unhygienic living conditions, or even directly referred to as cancer of the city; on the other hand, it offers a roof over the head for countless migrants who came to the city looking for job opportunities but cannot afford a normal life. Although it is closely related to phrases we never associate with home, such as sewage overflow,scattered garbage, and poor public security, the slum holds countless families. Moreover, the slum is spreading in the gaps of the city, gradually eroding it in astonishing scales. An unpleasant border has slowly formed in between the slum and the city packed with high-rise buildings. This border is irrelevant to territory or the conflict of politics and culture, yet it is a real issue in people's lives. As architects-to-be, we should try to find a way in response to the border issue emerged during the process of urban development.
