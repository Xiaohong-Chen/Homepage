		<h2>CONCEPTION</h2>
		<p>he slum is a paradoxical phenomenon in India. On the one hand, 
		it is regarded as the synonym of the worst, most unhygienic living conditions, 
		or even directly referred to as ¡°cancer of the city¡±; on the other hand, 
		it offers a roof over the head for countless migrants who came to the city looking for job 
		opportunities but cannot afford a normal life. Although it is closely related to 
		phrases we never associate with ¡°home¡±, such as sewage overflow, scattered garbage, 
		and poor public security, the slum holds countless families. Moreover, the slum is spreading 
		in the gaps of the city, gradually eroding it in astonishing scales. An unpleasant border has
	 	slowly formed in between the slum and the city packed with high-rise buildings. 
		This border is irrelevant to territory or the conflict of politics and culture, 
		yet it is a real issue in people¡¯s lives. As architects-to-be, 
		we should try to find a way in response to the border issue emerged during the process of urban development.</p>
